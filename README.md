# Open-Source and Modular Implementation of the Dislocation Extraction Algorithm (DXA)

`OpenDXA` performs dislocation analysis from a crystal-state package.
It is decoupled from the upstream structure-identification algorithm, but it is not
agnostic to lattice geometry: the matrix phase must exist as a reference lattice
definition under `OpenDXA/lattices` or in a runtime lattice directory.

## Overview

OpenDXA consumes three files from the same snapshot:

1. An annotated LAMMPS dump
2. A `*_clusters.table`
3. A `*_cluster_transitions.table`

Those files are currently exported by:

- [CommonNeighborAnalysis](https://github.com/VoltLabs-Research/CommonNeighborAnalysis)
- [PolyhedralTemplateMatching](https://github.com/VoltLabs-Research/PolyhedralTemplateMatching)
- [PatternStructureMatching](https://github.com/VoltLabs-Research/PatternStructureMatching)

If the producer respects the contract documented below, OpenDXA can consume it.

## OpenDXA Reference Lattices

OpenDXA resolves the matrix phase by `topology_name`.
Reference lattices are loaded from YAML files under `OpenDXA/lattices`.

Each OpenDXA lattice YAML currently contains only:

- `name`
- `coordination_number`
- `neighbor_vectors`

### Lattice Search Path

OpenDXA resolves reference lattices in this order:

1. `--lattice_dir`, when provided
2. The compile-time source lattice directory
3. `share/volt/lattices` relative to the executable/package

This means you can test new OpenDXA lattice YAMLs at runtime without recompiling by
passing `--lattice_dir /path/to/lattices`.

## Required Contract

OpenDXA expects the annotated dump, clusters table, and transitions table to come
from the same frame and to reference the same cluster IDs and topology names.

### Annotated Dump

The annotated dump must be a valid single-frame LAMMPS dump with at least these
headers:

- `ITEM: TIMESTEP`
- `ITEM: NUMBER OF ATOMS`
- `ITEM: BOX BOUNDS`
- `ITEM: ATOMS ...`

OpenDXA now derives the maximum reconstructed neighbor distance at import time from
the annotated atom positions and neighbor graph. It no longer requires a dedicated
dump header for that value.

The `ITEM: ATOMS` section must include:

- atom coordinates
- `cluster_id`
- `neighbor_indices_0` ... `neighbor_indices_17`
- `neighbor_lattice_x_0`, `neighbor_lattice_y_0`, `neighbor_lattice_z_0`, ... `neighbor_lattice_x_17`, `neighbor_lattice_y_17`, `neighbor_lattice_z_17`

Meaning of the reconstructed columns:

- `cluster_id`: cluster membership; `0` means no cluster / defect region
- `neighbor_indices_k`: zero-based atom index of slot `k`, in dump order; unused slots must be `-1`
- `neighbor_lattice_*_k`: ideal lattice-space vector assigned to slot `k`

The current reconstructed format reserves up to `18` neighbor slots per atom.
OpenDXA derives the effective neighbor count for each atom from the first `-1`
sentinel in the `neighbor_indices_*` slots.

### `*_clusters.table`

The clusters table must contain:

- `cluster_id`
- `topology_name`

It may also contain the optional orientation matrix columns:

- `orientation_00` ... `orientation_22`

Rules:

- `cluster_id` must match the `cluster_id` written into the annotated dump
- `topology_name` must match an OpenDXA lattice `name`
- the matrix phase passed as `--reference_topology` must match the dominant matrix `topology_name`

Examples:

- FCC matrix: `--reference_topology fcc`
- BCC matrix: `--reference_topology bcc`
- FCT matrix: `--reference_topology fct`

### `*_cluster_transitions.table`

The transitions table must contain:

- `cluster1_id`
- `cluster2_id`
- `tm_00` ... `tm_22`

Where:

- `cluster1_id` and `cluster2_id` define an undirected direct cluster interface
- `tm_00` ... `tm_22` define the `3x3` transition matrix between clusters

Rules:

- only direct interfaces are exported
- reverse duplicate rows are not required
- self-transitions are not serialized
- OpenDXA reconstructs reverse edges and self-transitions internally at import time

| `st` | 10 |

#### Adding a New PatternStructureMatching Lattice

To add a new lattice to PatternStructureMatching:

1. Create `plugins/PatternStructureMatching/lattices/<name>.yml`
2. Define:
   - `name`
   - `coordination_number`
   - `cell`
   - `coordinate_mode`
   - `basis`
3. Run PatternStructureMatching with:
   - `--lattice_dir /path/to/PatternStructureMatching/lattices`
   - `--patterns <name>`

Minimal example:

```yml
name: my_lattice
coordination_number: 8

cell:
  - [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]
  - [0.0, 1.0, 0.0]
  - [0.0, 0.0, 1.0]

coordinate_mode: fractional

basis:
  - species: 1
    position: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
```

#### Making a New PatternStructureMatching Lattice Usable by OpenDXA

If the new PatternStructureMatching lattice should also be consumable by OpenDXA:

1. Create `plugins/OpenDXA/lattices/<name>.yml`
2. Define:
   - `name`
   - `coordination_number`
   - `neighbor_vectors`
3. Run OpenDXA with `--lattice_dir /path/to/OpenDXA/lattices`
4. Ensure the upstream `topology_name` matches the same `<name>`

Minimal OpenDXA example:

```yml
name: my_lattice
coordination_number: 8

neighbor_vectors:
  - [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]
  - [-1.0, 0.0, 0.0]
  - [0.0, 1.0, 0.0]
  - [0.0, -1.0, 0.0]
  - [0.0, 0.0, 1.0]
  - [0.0, 0.0, -1.0]
  - [1.0, 1.0, 0.0]
  - [-1.0, -1.0, 0.0]
```

No OpenDXA code changes are required as long as:

- the producer emits a compatible reconstructed-state package
- `topology_name` matches the YAML `name`
- the matrix phase passed to `--reference_topology` exists in the OpenDXA lattice directory
